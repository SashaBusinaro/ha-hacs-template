## How to use this template

### 1. Create your repository

Click **"Use this template" → "Create a new repository"** on GitHub.

### 2. Enable GitHub Actions permissions

release-please needs permission to open pull requests on your behalf.

Go to **Settings → Actions → General** → scroll to **Workflow permissions** → enable
**"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** → click **Save**.

Without this, the release-please workflow will fail with a `403` error when it tries
to open a Release PR.

### 3. Add the HACS-required repository metadata

HACS validation requires both a **description** and at least one recognised topic.

From the GitHub UI (**top of the repo page → ⚙️ next to "About"**):

- **Description** — fill in the "Description" field (HACS will reject the repository without one).
- **Topics** — add at least one of: `home-assistant`, `hacs`, `home-assistant-custom`, `integration`.

### 4. Clone and run setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-user>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
scripts/setup
```

This creates a `venv/`, installs all dependencies, and installs the pre-commit hooks.
Pre-commit will now run automatically before every `git commit`.

### 5. Replace the placeholders

Use your editor's "Find in Files" (VS Code: `Cmd+Shift+F` / `Ctrl+Shift+F`) to
replace every occurrence of the tokens below across the whole repository.

<!-- placeholders-ssot:start -->

| Placeholder | Replace with |
|---|---|
| `integration_blueprint` | your integration domain (lowercase, pattern `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`), e.g. `my_integration` |
| `Integration blueprint` | your integration display name, e.g. `My Integration` |
| `YOUR_INTEGRATION_NAME` | your integration display name |
| `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` | your GitHub username |
| `YOUR_REPO_NAME` | your GitHub repository name |
| `SashaBusinaro/ha-hacs-template` | `<your-user>/<your-repo>` — **skip the URL ending in `.git`** in the "Keeping your fork in sync" section below; that one must keep pointing at the upstream template |

<!-- placeholders-ssot:end -->

Then rename the integration directory to match the new domain:

```bash
git mv custom_components/integration_blueprint "custom_components/<your-domain>"
```

You can delete this entire section from your README once the substitution is
complete — it only exists to drive the one-off setup.

### 6. Start developing

Open the repository in VS Code and choose
**"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"** to get a full Home Assistant instance running
locally with your integration already loaded.

VS Code is pre-configured with:

- **Run task → "Run Home Assistant"** to start the dev server.
- **F5 → "Home Assistant"** to launch HA under the debugger (breakpoints work in `custom_components/`).
- **Run task → "Lint"** to run Ruff format + check with auto-fix.

Or run the dev server directly from the shell:

```bash
scripts/develop
```

`scripts/develop` automatically activates the `venv/` created by `scripts/setup`,
so no manual activation is needed.

---

## Pre-commit

Pre-commit runs a set of fast checks before every `git commit`, catching issues locally
before they reach CI.

### Hooks included

| Hook | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `check-json` | Validates `manifest.json`, `translations/*.json`, `hacs.json` |
| `check-yaml` | Validates all workflow and config `.yml` files |
| `trailing-whitespace` | Removes trailing spaces |
| `end-of-file-fixer` | Ensures files end with a newline |
| `check-merge-conflict` | Blocks accidental merge-conflict markers |
| `ruff` | Lints Python and auto-fixes safe issues |
| `ruff-format` | Formats Python code |
| `codespell` | Catches common typos in code, comments and docs |

### Common commands

```bash
# Install hooks (once per clone — handled by scripts/setup)
scripts/setup

# Run manually on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run a single hook
pre-commit run ruff --all-files

# Update hooks to latest pinned versions
pre-commit autoupdate
```

> Ruff is pinned only in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; Dependabot's `pre-commit`
> ecosystem bumps it automatically every week.

## Releases (release-please)

This template uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
to automate changelogs and GitHub Releases — no manual tagging required.

### How it works

1. Merge commits to `main` following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec.
2. release-please opens (or updates) a **Release PR** that:
   - Bumps the version in `manifest.json`
   - Generates a `CHANGELOG.md` entry
3. Merge the Release PR → a GitHub Release and git tag are created automatically.

### Conventional Commits quick reference

| Commit prefix | Version bump | Appears in changelog |
|---|---|---|
| `feat: ...` | minor | Yes — **Features** |
| `fix: ...` | patch | Yes — **Bug Fixes** |
| `perf: ...` | patch | Yes — **Performance** |
| `feat!: ...` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer | major | Yes |
| `refactor: ...` | none | Hidden |
| `chore: ...` | none | Hidden |
| `docs: ...` | none | Hidden |
| `ci: ...` | none | Hidden |

**Examples:**

```
feat: add sensor for battery level
fix: correct unit of measurement for weight sensor
feat!: drop support for HA < 2025.1
chore(deps): update ruff to v0.12.0
```

### First release — v1.0.0

To produce exactly `v1.0.0` as your first release, add `Release-As: 1.0.0` to
the footer of any commit pushed to `main` before merging the first Release PR:

```
feat: implement sensor platform

Release-As: 1.0.0
```

release-please will accumulate all changes since the beginning and open a
Release PR that produces exactly `v1.0.0`, regardless of which commit types
were used.

---

## Dependabot

Dependabot opens **weekly grouped PRs** (every Monday) for:

| Ecosystem | PR strategy |
|---|---|
| GitHub Actions | Minor + patch versions bundled into one PR; major updates separate |
| Python (pip) | Minor + patch bundled; patch PRs wait 3 days, minor PRs 7 days before opening |
| pre-commit hooks | Weekly, ungrouped — keeps Ruff and the other hook pins current |
| Dev containers | Weekly, ungrouped |

`homeassistant` is excluded from automatic updates — it must stay in sync with
the `homeassistant` key in `hacs.json`. Bump them together manually.

---

## Keeping your fork in sync with the template

When the upstream template gets improvements you'd like to pull in, add it
as a `template` remote and merge selectively:

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/SashaBusinaro/ha-hacs-template.git
git fetch template
git merge template/main --no-ff --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Resolve conflicts on the files you've customized (typically `manifest.json`,
`hacs.json`, `README.md`, `custom_components/<domain>/`), then commit.

---

## Next steps

- Add **tests** using [`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component)
- Add **brand images** (logo/icon) to `custom_components/<domain>/brand/`
- Publish to HACS as a [Custom Repository](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/)
  or submit to the [HACS default store](https://hacs.xyz/docs/publish/start)
- Share on the [Home Assistant Community Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/)
